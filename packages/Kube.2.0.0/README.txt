And that's all. Now you can use the framework in their own style sheets.

Also included Javascript componenets;
- Connect kube.buttons.js
  <script type="text/javascript" src="./js/kube.buttons.js"></script>
  
- Connect kube.tabs.js
<script type="text/javascript" src="./js/kube.tabs.js"></script>

    If you need more tuning, you can download developer version. It includes LESS files with variables, mixins and modules.
